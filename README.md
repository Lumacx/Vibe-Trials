# Vibe Trials - Dojo Game Jam 6

This is a NextJS / Three JS / React / Dojo Engine starter in Firebase Studio.

I was able to complete 1 game (Stone Page) and set the other 4 elements at over 65% completion. Wind and Nature have some in this version but are not polish. Water and Fire need better assets and more time to go live.

I had issues connecting to the Blockchain due to the fact i did the frontend of the game yesterday and AI use NextJS and today when i tried to connect the Dojo example it was for REACT. I did a mess trying to adapt one or the other as well as using parts of Dojo.js, so please overlook the duplicate files and environments.

I'm not a dev but really enjoy AI and Gaming. Great Opportunity to explore both together. Hope you enjoy my Proto Dungeon Crawler.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx. and npm run dev -- --port 0 :-) Be patient on loading..

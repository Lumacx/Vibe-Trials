Vibe Trials – Images, 3D Assets and Backgrounds

Here's a detailed list of background visuals and 3D assets needed for each game and the home page, keeping in mind the Three.js and retro low-poly aesthetic. Many "assets" will be 3D models that the AI Studio will need to generate or find suitable placeholders for.
Visual Assets List

This comprehensive list of visual assets and backgrounds should guide the AI Studio in generating or preparing the necessary 3D elements for your game jam project. Remember that for the initial implementation, simple geometric placeholders are perfectly acceptable and can be refined later if time permits.
